## 8-bit 8x1 Multiplexer

**<u>Components</u>**
*seven* 8-bit 2x1 Multiplexer

**<u>Description</u>**

* 8 Inputs :- Each 8-bit string
* 1 Output :- One 8-bit string

* The truth table for a 8x1 Multiplexer is as follows where each $I_i$ is a 8-bit Signal.

| $\mathbf{S_2}$ | $\mathbf{S_1}$ | $\mathbf{S_0}$ | **Y** |
| :------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :---: |
|       0        |       0        |       0        | $I_0$ |
|       0        |       0        |       1        | $I_1$ |
|       0        |       1        |       0        | $I_2$ |
|       0        |       1        |       1        | $I_3$ |
|       1        |       0        |       0        | $I_4$ |
|       1        |       0        |       1        | $I_5$ |
|       1        |       1        |       0        | $I_6$ |
|       1        |       1        |       1        | $I_7$ |

**<u>Idea</u>**

* The purpose of the multiplexer was to select one of the 8 inputs based on the different value of the selector input
* To perform this a 2x1 Multiplexer was used to select one of the two inputs based on one-bit comparision of the three bits of selector input.
* The 2x1 Multiplexer were arranged in the same way as a Knockout Tournament. 
* 1st round had 4 MUX, 2nd had 2 MUX , 3rd had 1 MUX. Each MUX knocking one of the eight inputs of the 8x1 Multiplexer
